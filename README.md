# Starfield Shopping

A simple shopping list for Bethesda's Starfield.

## What is this for?

This is a simple way to compile and track all of the resources that you need to acquire for your current goal.
Before building this app I was using the notes app on my phone to write down what I needed. This got tedious very fast
if the list grew to more than a few items. 

Enter the Starfield Shopping app. This app allows you to quickly add items using a pre-determined list of all* resources
in Starfield (*If an item is missing or incorrect feel free to open a pull request to fix it). It will also display a running
estimated total of cost and weight so that you can be prepared when traveling between planets.
